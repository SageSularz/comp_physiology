## Comp Physio Lab notebook

### LAB 1: Intro to Data Analysis

-   Decided to use R as my primary stats platform instead of prism because I dont care to learn prism and prefer to use this as an opportunity to learn new skills in R

-   it was challenging to convert instructions from prism to R, good resources available for this online

-   L169- One way, **non-parametric** ANOVA used kruskal.test funct.

    \+ add on multi-comparison, Tukey funct. not compatible with kruskal instead used dunn.test function

-   L200- violin plot with box plots and whiskers, first time doing this I had to do some research, used "the R book" and online platforms to build this

    -   main problem is with error bar function I believe this has something to do the the fact that the hybrid cat. only occurs in the ab. tissue.

### Lab 2 & 3: Enzyme Activity and Temp

Primary questions:

1.  Is there a difference in MHD activity between mussels and crayfish?

2.  Is there a difference in MDH activity at different temperatures?

3.  Does the effect of temperature on MDH activity depend on the specific tissue type?

ASMT: Methods write up due 09-27-24

-   for lab 2 \>\> 1 graph, 2W ANOVA, q10 analysis

    -   Q10 = (R 2 /R 1 )\^(10/(T2 - T1 )

        Notes:

-   2W ANOVA

-   graph -\> y=activity x=temp (cont.) plot both species

-   idk how to do Q10 probs just going to calculate in excel and add after but this is something I should learn how to do

### Lab 4: Insect Metabolism

Primary Questions:

1)  Sex and Metabolic Rate

-   Unpaired t-test (assuming Gaussian distribution and SD)

-   graph of my choice

Is there a significant Difference between the sexes?

2)  Size and Metabolic Rate

-   simple linear regression (using log of x and y)

-   R squared val and p val

-   Tranform graph??

Is there
