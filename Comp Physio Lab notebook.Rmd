## Comp Physio Lab notebook

### LAB 1: Intro to Data Analysis

-   Decided to use R as my primary stats platform instead of prism because I dont care to learn prism and prefer to use this as an opportunity to learn new skills in R

-   it was challenging to convert instructions from prism to R, good resources available for this online

-   L169- One way, **non-parametric** ANOVA used kruskal.test funct.

    \+ add on multi-comparison, Tukey funct. not compatible with kruskal instead used dunn.test function

-   L200- violin plot with box plots and whiskers, first time doing this I had to do some research, used "the R book" and online platforms to build this

    -   main problem is with error bar function I believe this has something to do the the fact that the hybrid cat. only occurs in the ab. tissue.

### Lab 2 & 3: Enzyme Activity and Temp

**NOTE FOR METHODS - I have done my best with this data but switched groups between the days and the data from the first data was very inconsistent and I dont trust it. this had a large effect on my ANOVA and if this were a full write up it would be discussed but will not be in the methods of this report however I do recognize the error and its impact.**

Primary questions:

1.  Is there a difference in MHD activity between mussels and crayfish?

2.  Is there a difference in MDH activity at different temperatures?

3.  Does the effect of temperature on MDH activity depend on the specific tissue type?

ASMT: Methods write up

-   import data

-   create box plot in ggplot comparing species and temp

-   run 2way ANOVA

-   calculate Q10

### Lab 4: Insect Metabolism

Primary Questions:

-   What is the effect of sex on metabolic rate?\
    What is the effect of size on metabolic rate?\
    Is there a combined effect of sex and size on metabolic rate?\
    What is the effect of temperature on metabolic rate?\
    Is there a combined effect of sex and temperature on metabolic rate?\
    Is there a combined effect of size and temperature on metabolic rate?

    1)  Sex and Metabolic Rate

-   Unpaired t-test (assuming Gaussian distribution and SD)

-   graph of my choice

Is there a significant Difference between the sexes?

2)  Size and Metabolic Rate

-   simple linear regression (using log of x and y)

-   R squared val and p val

-   Tranform graph??

Is there
